The purpose of this datasets is to provide a new and improved set of benchmark landmark pairs with point-to-point correspondences for accurate DIR evaluation.


Disclaimer: This work is heavily based on R. Castillo et al.'s DIRLAB work (www.dir-lab.com). Please cite and give acknowledgement to their work if you found this datasets helpful. 

DIRLAB 4DCT lung images were used. Please refer to www.dir-lab.com  and the references papers for more details.


Note:
  1. Only landmark pair datasets were shared here. Please go to www.dir-lab.com to download original 4DCT datasets.
  2. When use this datasets, note that the first dimension and second dimention were swapped [y, x, z] compared to original DirLab landmark pairs [x, y, z].
  
  EE represents End-Exhalation phase
  EI represents End-Inhalation phase
